# Weather-Dashboard
This application seeks to use the Open Weather API to allow a user to search weather for a given city in order to plan a trip. When the user inputs a city and clicks the search button, the current weather for that city populates. This information includes the city name, date, an icon representing the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The UV index is color coded to indicate whether conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.

Future weather conditions for the city are represented via a 5 day forecast that displays the date, an icon representing weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.

Previously-searched cities are maintained in local storage and accessed via a search history list on the left of the screen. When the user clicks on a city from a previous search, they are presented with the weather conditions from the current moment.

This application utilizes AJAX and moment.js
